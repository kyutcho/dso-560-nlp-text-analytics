# DSO 560 NLP & Text Analytics

## Slack Workspace
We will be using Slack workspaces for most of our course communications, including submitting classwork, homework, and grading. Your final grades will be posted on Blackboard, but feedback for assignments will be delivered via Slack. Prior to Week 1's session, please join the Slack workspace. Note that this is a different Slack workspace than the auto-created workspaces by USC Marshall.

### Working With Git
* [Cloning/forking Github repositories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRxUGhMYHGQ). This video walkthrough takes you through how to clone/fork the course repository. Many students fork the course repository so that they can make local changes to the lecture notebooks and follow along. However, cloning/forking repos can be tricky. **Note that since this video was posted, the primary branch on Github has been renamed from `master` to `main`. Therefore, everywhere in the walkthrough you see `master`, substitute it for `main`.**

### Prior Years' Course Repositories

Feel free to look for examples from prior years. In general, there is a lot of overlap between course content year over year. However, keep in mind that each time I teach this course, approximately 25-30% of the content changes (due to adjusting for feedback, industry advances, etc.)
